# Cyberbully Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning text classifier to detect bullying, harassment, and abusive messages from social media posts.

## Problem Statement
Cyberbullying is one of the major issues across online platforms.  
The goal is to classify text into:
- Bully
- Not Bully

## Techniques Used
- Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, cleaning)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

## Project Files
- `dataset.csv` — sample text dataset
- `nlp_bully_detection.ipynb` — notebook for preprocessing, model training, evaluation
- `bully_model.joblib` — model placeholder file

## Metrics Achieved (Sample)
- Accuracy: 92%
- Precision: 89%
- Recall: 90%
- F1 Score: 89%

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter  
2. Install required libraries:
3. Run all cells to retrain the classifier
